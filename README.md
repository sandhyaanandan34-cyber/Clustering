# Clustering
<u>Overview</u>
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply clustering
techniques to a real-world dataset.

<h2>Findings</h2>
<h4>KMeans Clustering</h4>

Description:
  - KMeans partitions data into k clusters by iteratively assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids until convergence.

Why suitable:
  - Iris dataset has 3 natural species groups, making KMeans effective for discovering clusters.

<h4>Hierarchical Clustering</h4>

Description:
  - Hierarchical clustering builds a tree (dendrogram) of clusters by merging or splitting groups step by step.

Why suitable:
  - Iris dataset is small and balanced, allowing hierarchical clustering to reveal nested relationships.
